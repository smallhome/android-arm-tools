/*
 * The program is designed to test max_map_count tunable file
 *
 * The kernel Documentation say that:
 * /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count contains the maximum number of memory map
 * areas a process may have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect
 * of calling malloc, directly by mmap and mprotect, and also when
 * loading shared libraries.
 *
 * Each process has his own maps file: /proc/[pid]/maps, and each line
 * indicates a map entry, so it can caculate the amount of maps by reading
 * the file lines' number to check the tunable performance.
 *
 * The program trys to invoke mmap() endless until triggering MAP_FAILED,
 * then read the process's maps file /proc/[pid]/maps, save the line number
 * to map_count variable, and compare it with /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count,
 * map_count should less than max_map_count.
 * Note: There are two special vmas VDSO and VSYSCALL, which are allocated
 * via install_special_mapping(), install_specail_mapping() allows the VMAs
 * to be allocated and inserted without checking the sysctl_map_map_count,
 * and each /proc/<pid>/maps has both at the end:
 * # cat /proc/self/maps
 * ...
 * ...
 * 7fff7b9ff000-7fff7ba00000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0           [vdso]
 * ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0   [vsyscall]
 *
 * so during comparing with map_count and /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count,
 * we should except the two special vmas from map_count:
 * map_count -= 2;

	 * 1) use a safe maximum max_map_count value as upper-bound,
	 *    we set it 65536 in this case, i.e., we don't test too big
	 *    value;
	 * 2) make sure total mapping isn't larger tha
	 *        CommitLimit - Committed_AS
	 *    and set overcommit_memory to 2, this could help mapping
	 *    returns ENOMEM instead of triggering oom-killer when
	 *    memory is tight. (When there are enough free memory,
	 *    step 1) will be used first.
	 * Hope OOM-killer can be more stable oneday.
